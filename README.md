# DevOps-Essentials
This describes what DevOps Is

The culture of collabration between Development and Operation. The tools that Implement the DevOps, and the relation between the DevOps & Cloud.

# The Goals of the DevOps 

The goal of the development team is to Speed up the process of developing code for the End customer. 

The goal of the operations team is to maintain the stability of the system & minimize downtime.

So, everytime you changes the systems it changes in terms of stability. So, operation teams are used to maintain stability, while the development team is trying to deploy as many changes as possible. So, this two goals are quite opposition to one another. So, the DevOps culture is the development and operations both comes under the same team, share the same goals.

1. Fast-time-to Market. (Supply the product to the end customer)
2. Minimizing production failures. ( Until noticing the customers)
3. Immediate recovery for failures.

DevOps culture is to maintain the development & Operations care in terms of speed as well as stability. 

# The story of Traditional culture and DevOps culture

Traditional culture

The traditional culture is a type of when the development commits then the QA Team test and the operations teams check and say that the code has a problem and send back, So its becoming a big problem in the product delivery. 

DevOps culture

The developers commiting code will automatically integrate, build, test, delopy, So the developers come to know that what is happening. 

1. Dev write the code
2. Code commit trigggers the automated build, integration and Test
3. QA can get hands on it almost immediatly
4. Once it is ready, Kickoff an automated deployment to production
